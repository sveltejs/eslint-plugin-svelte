# svelte/prefer-destructured-store-props

> destructure values from object stores for better change tracking & fewer redraws

- :bulb: Some problems reported by this rule are manually fixable by editor [suggestions](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules#providing-suggestions).

## :book: Rule Details

This rule reports on directly accessing properties of a store containing an object in templates. These usages can instead be written as a reactive statement using destructuring to allow for more granular change-tracking and reduced redraws in the component.

An example of the improvements can be see in this [REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/7de86fea94ff40c48abb82da534dfb89)
